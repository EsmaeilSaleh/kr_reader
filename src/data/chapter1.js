            summary: `
This section introduces the structure of a basic C program using the classic 'Hello, World' example.

A C program is made up of functions. The main one is called \`main()\`, and it's where your program starts running.

The function \`printf()\` is used to print text to the screen. It comes from the standard library \`<stdio.h>\`, which we include at the top with \`#include <stdio.h>\`.

---

üîπ Basic Example:
\`\`\`c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\\n");
    return 0;
}
\`\`\`

Let‚Äôs break it down:
- \`#include <stdio.h>\` ‚Üí gives access to \`printf()\`
- \`main(void)\` ‚Üí your program‚Äôs entry point
- \`printf(...)\` ‚Üí prints text
- \`\\n\` ‚Üí moves to the next line
- \`return 0;\` ‚Üí tells the system everything went well

‚û°Ô∏è This is your first complete C program.
`,
            code: `#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\\n");
    return 0;
}`
        }
    ]
};

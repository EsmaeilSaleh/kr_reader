👋 **Welcome!** This section introduces the structure of a basic C program using the classic \`Hello, World\` example.

A C program is made up of functions. The main one is called \`main()\`, and it's where your program starts running. The function \`printf()\` is used to print text to the screen. It comes from the standard library \`<stdio.h>\`, which we include at the top with \`#include <stdio.h>\`.

---

  
\`\`\`c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\\n");
    return 0;
}
\`\`\`

🧠 **Let’s break it down:**

-  \`#include <stdio.h>\` → gives access to \`printf()\`
-  \`main(void)\` → your program’s entry point
-  \`printf(...)\` → prints text
-  \`\\n\` → moves to the next line
-  \`return 0;\` → tells the system everything went well

You've just written your first valid C program!

            code: `#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\\n");
    return 0;
}`
        }
    ]
};
